    <h2>What is the Design Services Program?</h2>
    <p>Design Trust Chicago was founded in 2020 with the mission of providing accessible design services to create equitable and thriving spaces and places for all Chicagoans. In an effort to continue to fulfill this mission, we are excited to launch in 2022 the Design Services Program to offer Chicago-based nonprofits and community organizations with a range of design services to bring their neighborhood projects to life. </p>
    <p>The goal of the program is to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support community projects that are aligned with values of spatial equity and justice,</li>
      <li>Serve communities of color that have not historically have access to design with design processes, and</li>
      <li>Expand design services that contribute to readiness of community-led projects.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Who is eligible?</h2>
    <p>The Design Services Program is available for community projects led by neighborhood organizations or groups. Eligible projects can be in different stages of development (from ideation and visioning to project development). The type of specific services provided by this program can include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Definitions of these services can be found below.</p>
    <h2>How do I apply?</h2>
    <p>Applications for the Design Services Program will be accepted twice a year, with the first round opening in May and the second round opening in November. Up to two projects will be chosen each cycle. </p>
    <p>Each cycle of applications will have a specific application deadline. The deadline for the first cycle of applications will be June 30, 2022 and projects will be selected and assigned by July 30, 2022. The deadline for the second cycle of applications will be December 30, 2022 and projects will be selected and assigned by January 2023. These deadlines are subject to change after the inaugural year of the program. </p>

    <h2>What organizations were selected for the Program from the first round of applicants?</h2>
    <p>Design Trust Chicago was grateful to work with two amazing organizations as a result of the first round of applications for the Design Services Program. </p>
    <p><a href=https://www.eziocdsinc.org>Ezio Community Development Services, Inc.</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization focused on community development, economic development, and community engagement. Design Trust Chicago is assisting Ezio in the design of a single-family home in the Manningdale neighborhood of Joliet, IL. Design Trust Chicago will be providing a schematic design package for the organization to use in their next phase of development. This project is part of a larger effort to establish a housing program that reinvigorates the Manningdale community and leads to long-term infrastructure improvements.</p>
    <p><a href=https://freespiritmedia.org>Free Spirit Media (FSM)</a> is a community youth organization servicing the South and West sides of Chicago. Design Trust Chicago is providing initial space visioning for the organization’s transition to a new space in the North Lawndale neighborhood, thus establishing a new community hub for youth development. Design Trust Chicago is co-creating a community engaged design process centering collaborative opportunities for facility improvement and are developing design documents to assist FSM in securing project funding through city grants. With Design Trust Chicago’s support, FSM was awarded $45,000 from the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) through the Together We Heal Creative Place Program (CPP).</p>
